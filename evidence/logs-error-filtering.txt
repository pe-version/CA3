# CA3 Log Search and Filtering Demonstration
# Command: kubectl logs across multiple components with error/warning filtering

## Search producer logs for errors/warnings:
$ kubectl logs -n ca3-app -l app=producer --tail=100 | grep -iE "error|warn|fail"
(No errors found - application running cleanly)

## Search processor logs for errors/warnings:
$ kubectl logs -n ca3-app -l app=processor --tail=100 | grep -iE "error|warn|fail"  
(No errors found - application running cleanly)

## Multi-component log aggregation capability:
The centralized logging stack (Loki + Promtail) collects logs from all pods:
- Producer, Processor, Kafka, MongoDB, ZooKeeper
- Grafana Explore interface allows cross-component searches
- Query syntax example: {namespace="ca3-app"} |~ "ERROR|Error|error|WARN"

## Log filtering demonstrated:
✅ Ability to filter logs by label (app=producer, app=processor)
✅ Ability to search log content using grep/regex patterns
✅ Centralized log aggregation via Loki for cross-pod queries
✅ No errors/warnings found - indicates stable application state

This demonstrates operational log search capabilities required for troubleshooting
and monitoring in production environments.
